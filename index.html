		<h2>Summer; The better season</h2>
		<p>
	It's no argument that summer is the better season; the sun, the sand, the crashing waves at the beach, even a few mosquito bites are all good reasons to favour summer over dreaded winter. Not only is summer a good season because of its sunny weather but also beacause it allows us to spend time with loved ones, participate in fun activties, and relax without a care in the world. Fun summer activties include; kayaking, going to the beach, hosting bonfires, and much more.
