		<h2> Why is winter the best season ever? </h2>
		<p>Ever since I was a child winter has always been my favorite season.there are so many great things about winter! Even though winter is the coldest season there is just something warm about it to me.Winter allows my family to spend quality time with one another that no other season allows. Whether its from staying up waiting to see if school was canceled/a delayed opening or from playing in the snow together, baking cookies or sipping hot chocolate together. Winter has such a warm feeling to it that everyone loves. During the coldest season the best memories are made and everyone shares a lot of laughter and love during it.

		<h2>Summer; The better season</h2>
		<p>
	It's no argument that summer is the better season; the sun, the sand, the crashing waves at the beach, even a few mosquito bites are all good reasons to favour summer over dreaded winter. Not only is summer a good season because of its sunny weather but also beacause it allows us to spend time with loved ones, participate in fun activties, and relax without a care in the world. Fun summer activties include; kayaking, going to the beach, hosting bonfires, and much more.
